# PHASE-4 — Cave Surfaces: the data contract between daemon memory state and the Coven Cave UI

**Status:** DRAFT (bead `threads-986.17.1` — written first, before any UI code; blocks `.17.2`–`.17.9`)
**Date:** 2026-07-15
**Upstream:** RFC-0001 §5 (Ward: gates, tiers, audit); `PHASE-0-DESIGN.md` (FROZEN v0.2) §2 metaphor bindings, §2.5 binding rule, §3.4 single audit store, §5 verdicts
**Substrate:** `coven-threads-core` v0.1.2 (98 tests green) + coven daemon integration branch `feat/threads-gate-validator` (PR OpenCoven/coven#382, merge gated on `threads-986.19`)
**Shape reference:** OpenTrust `docs/MEMORY-API-CONTRACT.md` / `docs/MEMORY-LAYER-STANDARD.md` — mirrored in *shape* (contract-first, evidence-over-summaries, freshness surfaced everywhere), **never in stack** (no Tauri, no Convex, no plugin architecture, no vendored code)

---

## 0. Ground rules (normative, inherited — violating any of these is wrong by declaration)

1. **Predicate authoritative, descriptor derived.** The UI MUST NOT present a
   `PatternDescriptor` (or any `describe()`-derived summary) as if it were
   enforcement. Descriptor content is always labeled derived. Every displayed
   *status* traces to a predicate result delivered by the read adapter.
2. **The UI never mutates protected memory.** All writes flow through the
   daemon. The Cave reads state and approves/rejects **staged** proposals only,
   by forwarding the decision to the daemon. No route in this contract writes
   to a protected surface, to `~/.coven/pending/`, or to `coven.sqlite3`.
3. **Gate 4 fail-closed is a rendering rule here.** Unknown, unverifiable, or
   daemon-absent state renders as **blocked / fail-closed** — never
   healthy-by-default. §4 enumerates every such state. A UI that shows a green
   pill it cannot trace to evidence is non-conformant.
4. **Metaphor-referent binding (§2.5) applies one layer up.** *Thread* =
   authority relationship surface → writer; *Weave* = enforced pattern of
   threads; *Strand* = fiber inside a thread; *Channel* = axis of load. UI copy
   uses these words only with their referents attached (§5 glossary). Nova
   reviews for code-to-UI coherence (blocking, `threads-986.17.8`).
5. **Implementation home is `coven-cave`, following `coven-cave` conventions**:
   every route registered in `src/app/api/api-contracts.test.ts`; every test
   file registered in `scripts/run-tests.mjs` `SUITES`; `pnpm typecheck`,
   `pnpm test:app`, `pnpm test:api` green before ready-for-review.

## 1. Sources of truth the Cave reads

| Source | Owner | What it holds | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weave state (via daemon; fixture mirror until `.19` merges) | daemon (`threads_gate.rs`) | `Weave` / `Thread` / `Strand` / `TensionState` per familiar | weave rail, thread pane, strand inspection |
| `ward_audit` table in `coven.sqlite3` | daemon (append-only; UPDATE/DELETE abort triggers) | one row per audit event (RFC-0001 §5.6 field set + coven-threads extensions) | audit lineage view, thread pane history |
| `~/.coven/pending/*.json` | daemon (atomic sibling-rename writes) | `PendingProposal` staged by `DegradeToProposal` | proposal approval flow |
| Daemon socket `~/.coven/coven.sock` | daemon | live API incl. additive `threadsGate` payload; approve/reject forwarding target | adapter `daemon-present`; POST forwarders |

**Two adapters, one interface (`.17.2`):**

- `daemon-absent` — reads fixtures from `coven-cave/fixtures/phase-4/`.
  **Default** until `threads-986.19` merges PR #382. In this mode every
  response carries `meta.adapter = "fixtures"` and the approval POST routes
  refuse (§3.7) — there is no daemon to forward to, so the action fails
  closed.
- `daemon-present` — reads the coven socket and the sqlite audit table.
  Same read-model shapes, `meta.adapter = "daemon"`.

Fixture states (minimum set, all ten): `weave-holds`, `weave-frayed`,
`weave-snapped`, `weave-unknown`, `daemon-timeout`, `audit-empty`,
`audit-with-lineage`, `pending-empty`, `pending-with-proposals`,
`pending-corrupt`.

## 2. Read models

Read models are the UI-facing JSON the Cave API returns. Adapters normalize
raw source encodings (serde externally-tagged enums, sqlite rows, staged JSON)
into these shapes; the raw form stays available under `trace` so every status
pill can open its evidence (OpenTrust trace-detail shape).

Conventions: camelCase keys; timestamps RFC 3339 strings; hashes/binary
lowercase hex strings; ids are strings (UUID or human-readable, as the source
defines them).

### 2.1 `TensionView`

The crate's `TensionState` has exactly three states. The *view* adds the two
UI-only fail-closed states — `unknown` arises when the adapter cannot fetch or
verify, `stale` when `staleAfter` has passed (§3.9). Neither exists in the
crate and neither may be persisted back toward it.

```jsonc
// state: "holds" | "frayed" | "snapped" | "unknown" | "stale"
{ "state": "holds" }

{
  "state": "frayed",
  "strand": "9f0c…-uuid | null",      // null = a required strand is missing
  "channel": "deliberate|forced|serialization|mutation",
  "reason": {                          // FrayReason, normalized
    "kind": "content-hash-mismatch|signature-invalid|manifest-entry-mismatch|audit-trail-unverifiable|required-strand-missing|serialization-marker-mismatch|other",
    "missingKind": "ContentHash|Signature|ManifestEntry|AuditTrail|SerializationMarker", // only for required-strand-missing
    "detail": "string"                 // only for other
  },
  "detectedAt": "2026-07-15T09:00:00Z"
}

{
  "state": "snapped",
  "channel": "…",
  "reason": { "kind": "revoked|multiple-strand-fray|pattern-broken|other", "detail": "…" },
  "at": "2026-07-15T09:00:00Z"
}

{ "state": "unknown", "why": "daemon-unreachable|unparseable|no-fixture|meta-missing" }
{ "state": "stale",   "lastKnown": { "state": "holds" }, "observedAt": "…" }
```

### 2.2 `WeaveSummary` and `WeaveDetail`

```jsonc
// WeaveSummary — the rail row
{
  "id": "weave-uuid",
  "familiarId": "sage",                // human-readable id, as ward_audit stores it
  "threadCount": 4,
  "tensionRollup": { "state": "frayed", "…": "worst contained thread state; §4.R1" },
  "coherence": "coherent|degraded|broken|unknown",   // predicate result — never the descriptor
  "degradedSurfaces": ["MEMORY.md"],   // present iff degraded
  "weaveHash": "hex"
}

// WeaveDetail — adds:
{
  "…": "all WeaveSummary fields",
  "threads": [ /* ThreadView, §2.3 */ ],
  "patternDescriptor": {               // derived — render only with the derived label (§4.R2)
    "derived": true,
    "summary": "…verbatim from describe()…"
  },
  "covenRef": "coven-uuid | null"
}
```

`tensionRollup` severity order (worst wins): `snapped` > `frayed` > `unknown`
> `stale` > `holds`. An unknown thread can never be out-ranked by a healthy
one — unknown is *worse* than holds by construction (fail-closed).

### 2.3 `ThreadView`

```jsonc
{
  "id": "thread-uuid",
  "surface": "SOUL.md",                // SurfaceId — the protected surface
  "writer": "familiar:sage",           // WriterId — who may propose writes
  "tension": { /* TensionView */ },
  "holdsUnder": ["mutation", "forced", "serialization"],   // covered channels
  "requiredStrands": {                 // per covered channel: Channel::required_strand_kinds
    "mutation": ["ContentHash"],
    "forced": ["ContentHash", "ManifestEntry"],
    "serialization": ["SerializationMarker"]
  },
  "strandCount": 3,
  "createdAt": "…"
}
```

### 2.4 `StrandView`

One shape per kind; `kind` discriminates. Committed material renders as hex.

```jsonc
{ "id": "…", "kind": "ContentHash", "algorithm": "blake3|sha256", "value": "hex" }
{ "id": "…", "kind": "Signature", "keyId": "…", "sigKind": "ed25519|principal-attestation", "value": "hex" }
{ "id": "…", "kind": "ManifestEntry", "manifestId": "…", "entryHash": "hex" }
{ "id": "…", "kind": "AuditTrail", "firstSeen": "…", "eventLogRef": "…" }
{ "id": "…", "kind": "SerializationMarker", "formatVersion": "0.1.0", "contractHash": "hex" }
```

On a Frayed thread, the strand the fray blames additionally carries the
current-vs-expected diff (`.17.5`):

```jsonc
{
  "…": "StrandView fields",
  "fray": {
    "expected": "hex | string",        // committed value from the strand
    "observed": "hex | string | null", // what the verifier saw; null = could not observe (renders blocked, not healthy)
    "observedAt": "…"
  }
}
```

### 2.5 `AuditEntryView` — one `ward_audit` row

Mirrors the append-only table (`WARD_AUDIT_SCHEMA_SQL`; RFC-0001 §5.6 set +
`validation_verdict` + `compaction_ledger`).

```jsonc
{
  "id": 412,                            // rowid — also the lineage cursor
  "eventType": "proposal_submitted|proposal_approved|proposal_rejected|proposal_vetoed|ward_updated|validation_verdict|compaction_ledger",
  "proposalId": "uuid | null",
  "familiarId": "sage",
  "wardVersion": "string | null",
  "wardHash": "hex",                    // weave_hash at decision time — binds decision to authority state
  "tier": "string | null",
  "decision": "permit | degrade_to_proposal | reject:<reason-tag> | …",
  "approver": "writer-id | null",
  "diffHash": "hex | null",
  "filesTouched": ["SOUL.md"],
  "channel": "mutation | null",
  "threadId": "uuid | null",
  "submittedAt": "…", "decidedAt": "…", "recordedAt": "…"
}
```

Lineage rule: an entry whose `proposalId`/`threadId` cannot be resolved to a
live object renders with an explicit unresolved-reference marker — it is
never dropped from the list silently (§4.R7).

### 2.6 `ProposalView` — one `~/.coven/pending/*.json` file

```jsonc
{
  "file": "<familiar-uuid>-<proposal-uuid>.json",
  "parse": "ok | corrupt",              // corrupt ⇒ payload null, §4.R6 applies
  "payload": {                          // PendingProposal, normalized
    "id": "proposal-uuid",
    "familiarId": "familiar-uuid",
    "writer": "familiar:sage",
    "channel": "mutation",
    "threadId": "thread-uuid",
    "fray": { /* FrayOrSnap verbatim for the principal, normalized like TensionView.reason */ },
    "edits": [
      { "surface": "MEMORY.md", "contents": { "encoding": "utf8|base64", "data": "…full desired contents, never diffs…" } }
    ],
    "stagedAt": "…"
  }
}
```

### 2.7 `DegradedFamiliarView` — a familiar whose ward config cannot be parsed

Amendment 2026-07-18 (bead `threads-k9s`, follow-up to `threads-vmf`/`threads-v60`).
A familiar with a ward.toml the daemon cannot deserialize must not vanish from
the weave rail (fail-visible) and must not abort the fleet read (coven#418).
The daemon includes one degraded entry per such familiar in the §3 route-1
response, alongside the healthy `{weave, coherence}` entries:

```jsonc
{
  "degraded": {
    "familiarId": "nova",                       // human id, same as weave.familiar_id
    "reason": "ward-config-unparseable",        // closed enum; only this value today
    "error": "missing field `principal_key_fingerprint`"  // single-line, sanitized parse error; no paths beyond the familiar home-relative ward.toml
  }
}
```

Compatibility: the entry carries no `weave` key, so pre-amendment Cave
normalizers drop it silently (older UI degrades to the previous skip
behavior); post-amendment normalizers render it per §4.R12. The daemon keeps
logging the full error to its recovery log.

## 3. API routes

All routes live in `coven-cave` `src/app/api/`, are registered in
`api-contracts.test.ts`, and return the envelope of §3.8. GET routes are
`kind: "json"`. The two POST routes are thin daemon-forwarders — they carry
the principal's decision to the daemon and return the daemon's outcome; they
never apply edits, never touch `pending/`, never write sqlite.

| # | Route | Method | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `/api/weaves` | GET | `WeaveSummary[]` — optional `?familiar=<id>` filter; degraded familiars surface per §2.7 + §4.R12 |
| 2 | `/api/weaves/[id]` | GET | `WeaveDetail` |
| 3 | `/api/threads/[id]` | GET | `ThreadView` |
| 4 | `/api/threads/[id]/strands` | GET | `StrandView[]` (with `fray` diff blocks where blamed) |
| 5 | `/api/threads/[id]/audit` | GET | `AuditEntryView[]` for this thread, newest first; `?before=<rowid>` pagination |
| 6 | `/api/proposals` | GET | `ProposalView[]` (both `ok` and `corrupt` entries) |
| 7 | `/api/proposals/[id]/approve` | POST | daemon outcome verbatim + envelope (§3.7) |
| 8 | `/api/proposals/[id]/reject` | POST | daemon outcome verbatim + envelope (§3.7) |

### 3.7 Approve/reject semantics (fail-closed)

- Body: `{ "note": "optional principal note" }`. `readsJson: true`,
  `invalidJson: "guarded"`.
- `daemon-present`: forward to the daemon socket; the daemon re-validates
  (staging is data, not authority — replay goes back through `validate`,
  RFC-0001 §5.4), applies or refuses, appends `proposal_approved` /
  `proposal_rejected` to `ward_audit`, and removes the pending file. The
  route returns the daemon's outcome verbatim.
- `daemon-absent` (fixtures mode) or daemon unreachable/timeout: **HTTP 503**,
  `{ "blocked": true, "why": "daemon-unavailable" }`. The UI renders the
  §4.R5 blocked treatment. No optimistic UI, no queued decisions.
- Proposal `parse: corrupt`: both actions disabled in the UI *and* the routes
  answer **HTTP 409** `{ "blocked": true, "why": "proposal-corrupt" }` if
  called anyway (§4.R6).

### 3.8 Response envelope — freshness on every response

Every response (success or blocked) is wrapped:

```jsonc
{
  "data": …,                            // route-specific read model, or null when blocked
  "meta": {
    "observedAt": "2026-07-15T09:00:00Z",  // when the adapter observed the source
    "staleAfter": "2026-07-15T09:00:30Z",  // when this observation stops being trustworthy
    "sourceCursor": "ward_audit:412 | weave:<weave_hash-hex> | pending:<dir-content-hash>",
    "adapter": "daemon | fixtures",
    "verified": true                       // false ⇒ §4.R8: render blocked
  },
  "blocked": false                      // true ⇒ data null, why present
}
```

`sourceCursor` is the monotonic (or content-addressed) identifier of the
source state backing the response: max `ward_audit` rowid for audit reads,
`weave_hash` for weave/thread/strand reads, a content hash of the pending
directory listing for proposals. Honest staleness beats fresh-looking lies:
adapters never fabricate `observedAt`.

### 3.9 Staleness

A client (or test) holding a response past `staleAfter` MUST render the §2.1
`stale` state: banner + last-known state, actions disabled. Stale never
silently re-renders as healthy; only a fresh fetch with a newer
`observedAt` clears it.

## 4. Fail-closed rendering rules (complete enumeration)

Every row is a test fixture in `.17.2` and a rendering test in `.17.3`–`.17.6`.
"Blocked" = the blocked pill/banner treatment: state is visibly not-healthy,
approval actions disabled, evidence trace still reachable.

| # | State | Detection | Rendering (never healthy-by-default) |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Thread/weave tension unknown | adapter returns `state: "unknown"` | Blocked pill; rollup treats unknown as worse than holds |
| R2 | Descriptor without predicate | `patternDescriptor` present, `coherence` unknown | Descriptor renders **only** with derived label; status area blocked |
| R3 | Daemon timeout | adapter timeout in `daemon-present` | Stale banner + last-known state; POST actions disabled |
| R4 | Daemon absent, no fixtures | neither source resolvable | Full-surface blocked state, "cannot verify" copy |
| R5 | Approve/reject while daemon unavailable | POST returns 503 | Action fails visibly; decision NOT queued; proposal stays pending |
| R6 | Corrupt pending file | JSON parse failure | Listed as `corrupt`, raw bytes inspectable, both actions disabled (409 if forced) |
| R7 | Audit entry with unresolvable refs | `proposalId`/`threadId` lookup fails | Entry shown with unresolved-reference marker; never silently dropped |
| R8 | Envelope missing/unverified `meta` | `meta` absent or `verified: false` | Contract violation ⇒ blocked; log loudly in dev |
| R9 | Stale response | now > `staleAfter` | §3.9 stale treatment |
| R10 | Snapped thread | `state: "snapped"` | Terminal treatment: read-only, "fresh authority ceremony required" copy; no repair affordance |
| R11 | Unknown route/id (404s) | id not in source | 404 with envelope, `blocked: true`; UI renders not-found as blocked, not empty-healthy |
| R12 | Familiar ward config unparseable | §2.7 `degraded` entry in weaves response | Blocked rail row named for the familiar, "ward unreadable — protection not verifiable" copy, sanitized error in trace, zero threads shown, all actions disabled; never silently absent (added 2026-07-18) |

Rollup arithmetic (R1, normative): `snapped > frayed > unknown > stale > holds`.

## 5. Metaphor-referent glossary for UI copy

Scoped to UI surfaces; each line is the binding UI copy must preserve
(`docs/glossary.md` is the full reference). Charm's voice pass (`.17.7`)
rewrites *tone*, never *referents*; Nova's review (`.17.8`) blocks on drift.

- **Weave** — this familiar's enforced pattern of threads; what the rail lists. Coherent iff its pattern predicate holds.
- **Thread** — one authority relationship, *surface → writer*; what a pane row is. Never "a conversation".
- **Strand** — one fiber of commitment inside a thread (hash, signature, manifest entry, audit anchor, serialization marker); what inspection shows.
- **Channel** — the axis of load a mutation arrives through: deliberate, forced, serialization, mutation.
- **Tension** — a thread's standing under load: **Holds** (full contract), **Frayed** (one strand failed; repairable; must surface to you), **Snapped** (terminal; fresh authority ceremony required).
- **Proposal** — a staged write awaiting the principal's decision; data, not authority.
- **Blocked** — the fail-closed rendering of anything unknown or unverifiable; honest, not alarming.
- **Derived** — descriptor-sourced summary for legibility; never what decided.
- **Trace** — the predicate evidence behind a status pill; every pill opens one.

Voice (for `.17.7`): patient, precise, evidence-first. Copy states what is
verified, what is not, and what the principal can do — it never reassures
beyond the evidence and never dramatizes a fray.

## 6. Out of scope (refuse politely, file a follow-up bead)

General policy engine; `.af` compatibility; replacing the daemon trust
boundary; any UI write path bypassing the daemon; Shape A/B portability
decision (`threads-986.16`); OpenTrust code vendoring or its Tauri/Convex
packaging; redesigning `coven-cave`'s shell beyond what the four surfaces
need; Phase 5+.

## 7. Conformance checklist for `.17.2`–`.17.6` closes

- [ ] Every route in §3 registered in `api-contracts.test.ts` with correct methods/kind/guards
- [ ] Both adapters answer every route with the §3.8 envelope
- [ ] All ten fixture states exist and are exercised
- [ ] Every §4 row has a test proving its rendering
- [ ] No code path renders healthy from unverifiable input (R1–R11 sweep)
- [ ] POST routes forward-only; grep-level check: no `fs.write`/`unlink` under the proposals routes, no sqlite writes anywhere in Cave API
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test:app`, `pnpm test:api` green
